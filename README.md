Under Construction Website
--------------------------

Files included:
- index.html         -> main page
- styles.css         -> CSS stylesheet
- script.js          -> small JS for countdown + demo notify
- README.md          -> this file

How to use:
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open index.html in any modern browser to view the page.
3. To host it, upload the files to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own server).

Notes:
- The email "notify" form is only a demo (no backend). Replace handleNotify() in script.js to connect to your backend or service.
- To change the countdown target edit the `end` variable in script.js.
